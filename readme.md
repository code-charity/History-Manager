Superb new tab page to treasure & apply your whole history whenever you need it! / faster than searching things again
 -  Chromium deletes history after 90 days. 
    -  'Senile storage' is a paradox   <i>(storage is to reduce forgetting, not promote it. Just like we also avoid Alzheimers & Snapchat)</i>

### [**chrome webstore PREVIEW version!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-manager/odognhgojidbcgconbcipmgffjcmfaoj)   (commit from [july26](https://github.com/code-charity/History-Manager-with-indexedDB/tree/453f6696892e1182c9667467e5a50927a72d71ba)  )

 Please just select* "SEARCH IN TABLES", to understand the essential feature - thats it for today. 
## to filter & make use of your history in multiple ways at once.

<i>*(should soon be a multi-search, requiring no selection) </i>

Also consider joining us please. We fulfill wishes since ~10 years https://github.com/code-charity  . Unfortunately we lost our main developer in 2022. :( 

 -  I think we  should use the most powerful JS lib for search with "(no)SQL" queries and more!   ( but not reinvent the wheel either way)

 -  While july26 (above)  is the most functional we got,   the current master.zip already has GUI updates/enhancements. 
     Please help us pick up/carry on our GUI lib too: https://github.com/code-for-charity/SATUS  I dont know why the "latest commits in this repo are the older ones"

- Maybe compare History Manager with this DEMO from feburary:  https://github.com/code-charity/History-Manager/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha.5 (it looks polished & has search in tables enabled by default. Yet missing data and features)
