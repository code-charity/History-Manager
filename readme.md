    Superb history manager to treasure (archive & apply) your whole history whenever you need it! <br> Smart summary and ranking (faster than searching things again). To let your computer storage work hand in hand with your vital, progessive brain memory, instead of starting from zero over and over again. Chromium deletes history after 90 days, but life is longer than that. (<i> Senile storage' is a paradox. Storage is to reduce forgetting, not promote it. Just like we also avoid Alzheimers & Snapchat </i>)

Please consider joining us. We fulfill wishes since 10+ years & unfortunately lost our main developer in 2022 :( 

 -  I think we  should use the most powerful JS lib for search with "(no)SQL" queries! (but not reinvent the wheel either way. SqlLite is also back for chrome https://www.sqlite.org/2024/sqlite-wasm-3450200.zip btw.)
    - Compare History Manager with this older version from feburary using neither DB (just JS) https://github.com/code-charity/History-Manager/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha.5 (it looks polished & has search in tables enabled by default. Yet missing some features)
 
-  While july26 (above)  is the most functional we got, the current master.zip already has GUI updates/enhancements. 
     Please help us pick up/carry on our GUI lib too: https://github.com/code-for-charity/SATUS  I dont know why the "latest commits in this repo are the older ones"
